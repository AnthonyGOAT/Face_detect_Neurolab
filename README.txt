
Welcome to my own version of Face detection app.
This app contributes to the application of the Neuro-machine Interaction Lab at USF.
This app complete the task #3 of the requirements.


What it does?

-This app simply detect faces and display a blue rectangle around the detected faces. It also counts the number of faces that appear on the webcam.
-Users can simply pause the recording click onto the python Video window (not the terminal), then
-press 'p' to pause the video
-press 'c' to continue the video
-press 'q' at anytime to quit the program.



How do I build it?

-This app was built on my knowledge of Python and cv2 library, which is openCV. My first intention is that train my own database for the app, however, face-detection database is integrated into Python and openCV.
I then download the trained data on the internet, this data utilized Haar Cascades to train. Afterwards, I imported the necessary libraries: numPy and cv2. I built my code base on the database using Python. The rest of the work
is done by myself.



How can it be used?

-Before you execute and run the file, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed in your computer.
-Make sure you download the latest version of Python on your computer (My version is 3.7)
-Open the terminal and let's run this code:

MacOS/Linux/Unix users: 

-To install the openCV library:
sudo pip install opencv-python

-To install the numPy library:
sudo pip install numpy

You are now ready to run the program:
python3 Face_detect_Neurolab.py


Window users:
-I highly recommend installing git bash to work on this code because Window does not really work on this. You can download here: https://git-scm.com/downloads


-To install the openCV library:
pip install opencv-python

-To install the numPy library:
pip install numpy

You are now ready to run the program:
python Face_detect_Neurolab.py





ENJOY!!!
